# lightcurves

This is a repo of the GRB Afterglow Lightcurve Calculator, galc.py.  It's based off of some code by Davide Lazzati at Oregon State University.

Full documentation is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/deichdeich/lightcurves/wiki) attached to this repository, and you can see a few examples of the code's usage in the IPython notebook which is also in this directory.
